After you have run git add .
remove the node modules, because you don't want to keep track of it, so run this command on the terminal


git rm --chached -r node_modules

then if you do git status, you will see that the modules won't be cached.

Then create add the node_modules to the .gitignore file
ex:
	on terhminal:	touch .gitignore

	open the file and just add: node_modules/

     -> if see the status, notice that the .gitinore file is not cached
